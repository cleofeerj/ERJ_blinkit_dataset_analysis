QUESTIONS:

1.) Total Sales by Fat Content:

Objective: Analyze the impact of fat content on total sales.
Additional KPI Metrics: Assess how other KPIs (Average Sales, Number of Items, Average Rating) vary with fat content.
Chart Type: Donut Chart.

2.) Total Sales by Item Type:

Objective: Identify the performance of different item types in terms of total sales.
Additional KPI Metrics: Assess how other KPIs (Average Sales, Number of Items, Average Rating) vary with fat content.
Chart Type: Bar Chart.

3.) Fat Content by Outlet for Total Sales:

Objective: Compare total sales across different outlets segmented by fat content.
Additional KPI Metrics: Assess how other KPIs (Average Sales, Number of Items, Average Rating) vary with fat content.
Chart Type: Stacked Column Chart.

4.) Total Sales by Outlet Establishment:

Objective: Evaluate how the age or type of outlet establishment influences total sales.
Chart Type: Line Chart.


5.) Sales by Outlet Size:

Objective: Analyze the correlation between outlet size and total sales.
Chart Type: Donut/Pie Chart.

6.) Sales by Outlet Location:

Objective: Assess the geographic distribution of sales across different locations.
Chart Type: Funnel Map.

7.) All Metrics by Outlet Type:

Objective: Provide a comprehensive view of all key metrics (Total Sales, Average Sales, Number of Items, Average Rating) broken down by different outlet types.
Chart Type: Matrix Card.

8.) Determine the relation of Item Visibility & Sales




Initial Analysis in EXCEL:
1. Indentified the blank values - Item Weight. Then filled blank values with null to avoid problems in importing.
2. Created a new column for Item Weight that has the values and the nulls. 


DATA CLEANING:

-- 1.) DUPLICATE DATASET
-- 2.) »¿Item Fat Content to Item Fat Content
-- 3 - 4.) CHANGE THE INCOSISTENT VALUES (LF, low fat, reg)
-- 5.) SPACES
-- 6.) NULL VALUES (Just double checking)
-- 7.) REMOVING DUPLICATE DATA
-- 8.) Replaced Null Values in Item_Weight_New
-- 9.) REPLACE 0 VALUES - Item Visibilty
-- 10.) UPDATE DATA TYPES
-- 11.) ANSWER QUESTIONS



STEPS DONE - DATA CLEANING:
1.) Duplicated Dataset
2.) Fixed the column name - Item Fat Content.
3-4.) Updated the inconsistent values in Item Fat Content - LF, low fat, reg.
5.) Trimmed the spaces in the beginning of the values in Item_Weight_New & Sales.
6.) Double checked the Null values. 
7.) Identified the duplicate data. 
	- Added row_num that identifies unique rows, 1 & 2 (duplicate). 
	- Created a temporary table to filter the duplicate (2's)
	- Since it is not deleteable, we create a table that has the row_num column. Inserted the row_num column.
	- Insertion of data into the new table
	- DELETE THE DUPLICATES (2's)
8.) Replaced Null Values in Item_Weight_New
	- Created a column RowNum for determining Groups. Count within each group for determining if it is 
	  ODD or EVEN for getting the Median.
	- Made a code for the calculations of median.
	- Updated the values.

SAMPLE FLOW: 

ODD:
Input Group: Item_Weight_New = [3, 5, 7, 9, 11]
TotalCount = 5 (odd).
Median = (5 + 1) / 2 = 3rd row = 7.

EVEN:
Input Group: Item_Weight_New = [3, 5, 7, 9]
TotalCount = 4 (even).
Median = AVG(2nd row, 3rd row) = (5 + 7) / 2 = 6.


9.) REPLACE 0 VALUES - Item Visibilty 
	- ALL OF THE OPERATIONS ARE THE SAME AS THE NUMBER 8.

10.) UPDATE DATA TYPES - Item Identifier, Outlet Identifier, Outlet Location Type, Outlet Type, from TEXT INTO VARCHAR.
